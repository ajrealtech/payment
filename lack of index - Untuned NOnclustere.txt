lack of index - Untuned NOnclustered Indexes -  SQL queries is missing indexes on the columns that are used in the WHERE, JOIN, ORDER BY, or GROUP BY clauses.

inefficient joins -  use specific join along with condition

Suboptimal subqueries

Excessive Aggregation function  -  To avoid excessive aggregation, you should only use aggregation functions on columns that have high cardinality (i.e., they have many distinct values) and that are relevant to your query.

N+1 query problems

Improper Data Types - you should choose the data types that match the nature and size of your data, and that are compatible with the data types of the columns or variables that you compare or join. You should also avoid using generic or large data types such as VARCHAR(MAX) or NVARCHAR(MAX), unless you really need them


Query Plan 

Wild Card characters and row goals like top,exits


Apart from that there can be issue like Database configuration issues, hardware or OS limitation like insufficient ram, 
limited harddisk ,  inadequate cpu
 
Procedure

Set NOCount On , it reduce network trips

Fetch only required columns,Not select *

Avoid using cursors

Transfer the relevant record to local carriable to disconnect table reference. Prefer local variable instead of temp tables

create views for repeated select query

keep transaction block short  to avoid lock and deadlock

create non clustered index which can be used in explain plan

use if exist,  try/catch for error hadling

use schema name which is useful to compile plan




DMV dynamic management can be used server state information trouble shooting performance related issues

You can use dynamic management views (DMVs) to monitor workload performance and diagnose performance problems, 
which might be caused by blocked or long-running queries, resource bottlenecks, suboptimal query plans, and more.
